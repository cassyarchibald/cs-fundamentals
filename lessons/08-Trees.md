## Notes

### Tree Vocabulary

- a **node** is where one value in a tree is stored. Each node contains a value and references to its child nodes.
- the **root** of a tree is the topmost node, or the node in the tree with no parents.  
- the **parent** of a node is the one which references the given node directly.
- a node's **siblings** are nodes which share the same direct parent.  
- a **descendant** of a node is a node which can be reached directly or indirectly from the given node.  
- an **ancestor** of a node is a node which refers directly or indirectly to the given node.  The root node is the ancestor for all nodes in the tree.  
- a **leaf node** is a node with no descendants.  
- an **edge** of a tree is a connection between nodes.
- a **path** in a tree is a series of nodes that can be traversed from one node to another.  
- the **level** of a node is 1 + the number of nodes between the given node and the root.
- the **height** of a node is the longest path between that node and one of it's leaf descendants.  
- the **depth** of a node is the number of edges from the root to the node.
- **traversing** through a tree is navigating through a tree

### Traversing a Tree
There are three common ways to iterate through a tree called a `traversal`, in-order traversal, pre-order traversal and post-order traversal.  

- In an **inorder traversal** we traverse the left child first then the parent and then traverse the right child. Inorder Traversal is usually only applied to binary search trees.  
-  A **preorder traversal** we visit the current node first and then traverse the left subtree and then traverse the right subtree.
-  A **post-order** traversal involves traversing the right and left subtrees and then visiting the current node.  

### Special Trees

- a **binary tree** is a tree in which each node has at most 2 children (bi implies 2)
- a **full binary tree** is a binary tree where every node except the leaves has two children.  
- a **full tree** is a binary tree where every level at every level except the bottom-most level has the maximum number of children (2).  
- a **Binary Search Tree** is a binary tree where the left child of a node is always smaller than it's parent and every right-child of a node is larger than it's parent.  
- a **subtree** is the tree formed by the left or right children of a given node.  

### Binary Search Trees
Binary Search Trees have a few differences compared to linked lists.

Superficially
-  Each node can point to up to two (hence "bi-" prefix) other nodes
-  There is no single end to a tree, rather many leaves  

Performance:
-  It's potentially much faster to find elements in a Binary Search Tree
-  Each node is slightly bigger in terms of memory footprint and there is some overhead involved in keeping the tree balanced
