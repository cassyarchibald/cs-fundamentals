# CS FUN(damentals) Series
This series was developed to teach CS fundamentals to new programmers in a condensed amount of time. The major goal of these lessons is to teach jargon and high-level concepts so that new programmers can recognize "mumbo jumbo" in the industry and have a mental model of concepts to properly communicate with their teammates.
